# 🌐 Web Development Learning Repository

Welcome to my Web Development repository!  
This repo contains all the projects, mini-apps, and assignments I've built while learning frontend development. It’s a collection of hands-on practice using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, following tutorials, online courses, and personal exploration.

🚀 **Live Demo:**

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```git clone https://github.com/vaidika1410/Web-Development.git
   cd Web-Development```

2. Open any .html file directly in your browser:

    ```open clock.html```

    Or right-click > open in browser (or use Live Server if using VS Code).


🎯 Future Goals
Organize projects into folders by topic

Add screenshots or previews for each project

Create a styled landing index.html to list all projects

Add more JavaScript interactivity and APIs

Explore backend integration (Node.js / Firebase)
